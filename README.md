## Welcome to the Multimodal Gen AI Hack, hosted by Intel Liftoff! üöÄ

This hackathon focuses on Multimodal Generative AI, which enables you to create applications that combine various data types, such as text, images, and audio. You can explore two main approaches:

üîß The Engineering-Driven Approach: Combine specialized models for each modality to create a tailored pipeline. For instance, you could use Whisper for audio transcription, pass the text to an LLM like Llama 3.1 for generating creative prompts, and then visualize the output using an image generation model like Stable Diffusion. This modular approach is well-suited for tasks such as developing an AI-driven content creation pipeline or an interactive storytelling system.

üåê The Pure Multimodal Model Approach: Utilize state-of-the-art models like LLaVA-NeXT or Moondream, which integrate vision transformers (ViT) and LLMs into a single model. These models can process multimodal inputs end-to-end, enabling applications like visual question answering, where the system can comprehend an image and respond to queries about its content. For example, you could create an AI agent for retail that analyzes product shelf images and takes action by generating insights about restocking, suggesting promotions, or notifying relevant teams.

To make things even more exciting, we have a variety of prizes up for grabs, thanks to our fantastic startup partners in the Liftoff program.

### Intel Developer Cloud
   
- üåê Step into the [Intel Tiber AI Cloud](https://cloud.intel.com) (IDC), register for free, and access Intel Xeon CPUs, GPUs, & HPUs. Discover a set of curated notebooks for Stable Diffusion, LLM inference, fine-tuning, and more under the `Learning` section.
- **This will give you access to:** 
  - **Jupyter Notebook:** Work within a Jupyter Notebook environment, optimized for Generative AI challenges.
  - **Disk Space:** Up to 30GB per user (depending on availability).
  - **GPU:** Intel GPU with 48GB memory (Data Center Max 1100), tailored for AI applications.
  - **HPU:** Intel Gaudi2 (Habana) with 96GB memory, ideal for Gen AI applications.

---

### How to Build and Deploy Your Application

We recommend starting with the **free Jupyter notebooks** available in the **Learning** section for experimentation. These notebooks are perfect for:

- Prototyping your project with AI models like Stable Diffusion and LLMs in a pre-configured environment.
- Experimenting with Generative AI workflows before deployment.

üí° **Need dedicated Hw for deployment?** While Jupyter notebooks are ideal for experimentation, they are not suited for production deployments. If your project requires **dedicated compute resources for deployment**, let us know. We may provide access to **Intel GPU or CPU VMs** on a **limited, case-by-case basis** due to resource constraints.

---

### Building Outside the Cloud

If you're using only the hosted APIs we‚Äôve provided, feel free to build your project on any platform of your choice. However:

- **‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** Using other hosted API services for this challenge is not allowed.  
  This ensures fair usage and encourages participants to explore the tools and resources we‚Äôve specifically made available.
